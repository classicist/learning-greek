        <b>Bleeding Edge</b> which gives you immediate access to activities as they are released (so there may be problems).
    {% elif user.preference.adoption_level == "early-adopter" %}
        <b>Early Adopter</b> which means you will have access to activities once they have been tried out by at least 10 other people.
    {% elif user.preference.adoption_level == "mainstream" %}
        <b>Mainstream</b> which means 100 people have to already have tried an activity before you can. Note that this means it may be a long time before activities are available to you.
