        I&rsquo;m building <span style="font-weight: 300">Learning</span><b>Greek</b> partly to help people learn Koine Greek and partly to research how to improve the way people learn Koine Greek.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I&rsquo;m starting small but have ambitious goals. I&rsquo;m eventually going to need a lot of people to use the site to get the data I need. But I also want to teach a lot of people Koine Greek.
